# ðŸ”¢ K-NN Machine Learning
My self-introduction to machine learning.  
Simple application that recognises handwritten/mouse drawn digits from 0-9. 

The plan for the program was as follows:
* create a Y x Y painting region
* when a number is drawn its added to the training data along with all Y^2 pixels
* this training data is used to plot a Y^2-dimensional map
* the distance between data is calculated with pythagoras but for Y^2-dimensions
* classify the drawing based on the k (15 in the program) nearest neighbours in the training set

## Get It Running
This program uses vanilla python so there are no required libraries.  
Just clone the repo and get started!  

## Info
Finished 25th December 2019
